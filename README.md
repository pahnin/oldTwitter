Like me, if you too want to see twitter.com like this in your firefox
![Old twitter](http://i.imgur.com/xI29vAD.png)
Instead of looking like this
![New style](http://i.imgur.com/jHlzPjz.png)
I packed some [code](https://github.com/pahnin/oldTwitter/blob/master/data/fireChanges.js) in a small [extension](https://github.com/pahnin/oldTwitter/blob/master/oldtwitter.xpi) 

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/oldtwitter/

## Known issues

- Sometimes who to follow still shows up on profile page (pages are heavily modified, time locks may cause this)
  But they dissapear when you reload page on profile page

## Notes
I'm trying to continuosly support this add-on as twitter changes its layout.
Twitter may suddenly change the whole layout, I can't know earlier because I don't work for twitter.
So suddenly you may see everything scrambled, don't panic, just disable the add-on and file a bug, I'll attempt to fix it.
